## Database

### Setup

For the database we use MariaDB.  
Database name: "main"  
User: "admin"  
Password: "password"  

The database needs to be installed and configured first.
```
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo mysql -e "GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION"
mysql -u admin -p password -e "CREATE DATABASE main"
```

### Rendering the Database in the Browser

If you want to render the database using a web server with PHP, put the index.php 
into /var/www/database/ 

An example setup for using the Apache web server:
```
sudo apt install apache2 php php-mysql
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/database
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/database
sudo cp index.php /var/www/database/
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo a2ensite database.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```
